      <h3>topics</h3>
      <h4>Review</h4>
      <h5>semantic tages</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Comments can be added to HTML codes using <code>!</code>, but in CSS, it would be added using the /* and */ paires. </li>
        <li>Hody should contain everything except for the head and the footer </li>
        <li>li contains individual list items</li>
        <p>p contain paragraphs </p>

      </ul>

      <h5>coding rules</h5>
      <p>In general, the HTML script should be properly indented with child having one more level from its parent. Also, not all elements would have a closing tag. For instance, the img element only has one tag - "void tags." There should be no
        spaces in an attribute declaration (something to really note when writing) and that file paths should be relative. It is also highly recommended to have an alternative text for all images used in case the image doesn't load.</p>

      <h5>CSS selectors</h5>
      <p>The different selectors can help depict which HTML level the CSS is refering too. in general, the tag is broader than a class, than an id. And pseudo classes/elements can be used to furthur specify the item that the CSS style is applied on
      </p>
      <h5>CSS style placement</h5>
      <p>The CSS style can be placed in three different places: an external CSS file that can be linked in the HTML head tag, a seperate style tage in the HTML head tag, and as in-line in the tags that is used in the body (which should be the last
        resolution)</p>
      <h5>box model</h5>
      <p>The box model helps define the margin, border, and padding of the content. It is helpful to use the browser inspector to see where the box model are. Be sure to specify the side of the margin/border/padding if necessary to avoid weird white
        spaces. To avoid sizing issues, one can create a box-sizing: border box to make all elemnts use border-box.</p>
      <h4>Positioning items in CSS</h4>
      <p>The positioning in CSS can be static (by default, will stay the same place where it was coded in HTML), relative (to the normal position with offsets), absolute (relative to its reference point), and fixed (position relative to the window)
      </p>
      <p>the Float property allows the item to be taken out of the normal flow of the HTML content, and the item floated can be speified by usin clearfix to its child items.</p>
      <h4>Fonts</h4>
      <p> fonts can be different depending on the machine because not all machine downloaded the same fonts. Therefore, when declaring fonts, it is important to have start with a priority font, and provide an alternative font option. Lastly, include
        a generic font family in case both fonts indicated previously does not run.</p>
      <p>One place to obtain more fonts is Google fonts. In google fonts, one must include a link in the HTML file so the page can be directed to the google font and download the appropriate fonts for the individual machines.</p>
